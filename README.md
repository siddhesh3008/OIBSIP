### 2. **BMI Calculator**

#### Description
Create a command-line BMI calculator in Python to help users assess their health based on their body mass index (BMI).

#### Features
- Prompt the user for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Calculate BMI using the formula:
  \[
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2}
  \]
- Categorize BMI into predefined health ranges:
  - **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5
  - **Normal weight**: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
  - **Overweight**: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
  - **Obesity**: BMI ≥ 30
- Display the BMI result and health category.

#### Technologies
- Python
- Command-line application.

### 3. **Simple Password Generator**

#### Description
Build a Python-based command-line password generator to create secure passwords based on user-defined criteria.

#### Features
- Generate passwords with:
  - Letters (uppercase and lowercase).
  - Numbers.
  - Special symbols.
- Allow users to specify:
  - Password length.
  - Inclusion of specific character types.
- Ensure strong, random password generation for enhanced security.

#### Technologies
